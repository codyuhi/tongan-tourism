 _The official Tongan Tourism website leaves a lot to be desired and gives an archaic perspective to the country as a modern tourism destination. This project is a partially philanthropic effort to postulate on what a more effective website design/application might look like_

 ## Existing site

_TODO: Perform market research on existing Tongan website design practices_

 ## Design Docs

_TODO: Create design documents for a replacement Tongan website_

 ## Tech Stack

 _TODO: Define what technology/features might be required, nice to have, etc. for running this website in a cost-efficient, reliable, and feature-rich way_

## TODO

- Perform market research to see existing Tongan Website design practices
- Create design docs for how it might look
- Define tech stack for the site
- Create MVP pages for all required views
